## Introduction

This is a project for LiDAR to camera calibrationï¼Œ including automatic calibration and manual calibration.

## Prerequisites

- Cmake
- opencv 2.4
- eigen 3
- PCL 1.9
- Pangolin

## Compile
Compile in their respective folders

```shell
# mkdir build
mkdir -p build && cd build
# build
cmake .. && make
```

## Manual calibration tool

1. Four input files: 

   ```
   Usage: ./run_lidar2camera <image_path> <pcd_path> <intrinsic_json> <extrinsic_json>
   ```
+ **image_path:** image file from the Camera sensor
+ **pcd_path:** PCD file from the Lidar sensor
+ **intrinsic_json:** Camera intrinsic parameter JSON file
+ **extrinsic_json:** JSON file of initial values of extrinsic parameters between sensors
</br>


2. Run the test sample:

   The executable file is under the bin folder.

   ```
   cd ~./manual_calib/
   ./bin/run_lidar2camera data/0.png data/0.pcd data/center_camera-intrinsic.json data/top_center_lidar-to-center_camera-extrinsic.json
   ```

3. Calibration panel:

   <img src="./images/lidar2camera_panel.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="lidar2camera_panel" div align=center /><br>

   The calibration window consists of the left control panel for manual calibration and the right point cloud projection image. Users can check whether the points cloud and the image are aligned by clicking the corresponding button in the panel or using Keyboard as input to adjust the extrinsic parameter. When the points cloud and the image are aligned, the calibration ends, click the save button to save the result.  

   | Extrinsic Params | Keyboard_input | Extrinsic Params | Keyboard_input |

   |    +x degree     |       q        |    -x degree     |       a        |
   |    +y degree     |       w        |    -y degree     |       s        |
   |    +z degree     |       e        |    -z degree     |       d        |
   |     +x trans     |       r        |     -x trans     |       f        |
   |     +y trans     |       t        |     -y trans     |       g        |
   |     +z trans     |       y        |     -z trans     |       h        |

   | Intrinsic Params | Keyboard_input | Intrinsic Params | Keyboard_input |
   | :--------------: | :------------: | :--------------: | :------------: |
   |       + fy       |       i        |       - fy       |       k        |
   |       + fx       |       u        |       - fx       |       j        |

   ```Intensity Color```: LiDAR intensity is recorded as the return strength of a laser beam, partly based on the reflectivity of the object struck by the laser pulse. This button can change the display mode to intensity map display mode. This can help to check if the ground lane lines are aligned.

   ```	Overlap Filter```: Eliminate overlap Lidar points within a depth of 0.4m. 

   ``deg step`` ``t step `` ``fxfy scale`` : These three buttons change the adjustment step for every click or keyboard input.

   ``point size``: Adjust the size of Lidar points in the projection image.

   ``Reset``:  Press button to reset all manual adjustment.

   ``Save Image``:  If the this button was pressed, the results (calibrated image,  extrinsic and intrinsic matrix) are stored by default at running directory `~./manual_calib/`:

## Automatic calibration tool

This automatic and user-friendly calibration tool is for calibrating the extrinsic parameter of LiDAR and camera in road scenes. Line features from static straight-line-shaped objects such as road lanes, lights, and telegraphy poles are extracted for both image and LiDAR point cloud, later on, calibration will be achieved by aligning those two kind of features.

**Note:** To get line features for image like Figure below, please refer to [README.md](auto_calib/tool/README.md) to extract image features.

## Usage

1. Five Input files: 

   ```
   Usage: ./run_lidar2camera <mask_path> <pcd_path> <intrinsic_json> <extrinsic_json>
   ```

- **mask_path**: feature extracted image get by the pre-trained segmentation model
- **pcd_path**: PCD file from the Lidar sensor
- **intrinsic_json**: Camera intrinsic parameter JSON file
- **extrinsic_json**: JSON file of initial values of extrinsic parameters between sensors

2. Run the test sample:

   The executable file is under the bin folder.

   ```
   cd ~./auto_calib/
   ./bin/run_lidar2camera data/mask.jpg data/calib.pcd data/center_camera-intrinsic.json data/top_center_lidar-to-center_camera-extrinsic.json
   ```

3. Calibration result:

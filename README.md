# SensorsCalibration toolbox

SensorsCalibration is a simple calibration toolbox and open source project, mainly used for sensor calibration in autonomous driving.

## Introduction

Sensor calibration is the foundation block of any autonomous system and its constituent sensors and must be performed correctly before sensor fusion may be implemented. Precise calibrations are vital for further processing steps, such as sensor fusion and implementation of algorithms for obstacle detection, localization and mapping, and control. Further, sensor fusion is one of the essential tasks in autonomous driving applications that fuses information obtained from multiple sensors to reduce the uncertainties compared to when sensors are used individually. To solve the problem of sensor calibration for autonomous vehicles, we provide a sensors calibration toolbox. The calibration toolbox can be used to calibrate sensors such as **IMU, LiDAR, Camera, and Radar**.

## Environment(Quick Start)
```shell
# pull docker image
sudo docker pull scllovewkf/opencalib:v1
# After the image is pulled down, start the docker image.  /home/sz3/ailab/ =  code root path on your host
docker run -it -v /home/sz3/ailab/:/share scllovewkf/opencalib:v1 /bin/bash
# or
sudo ./run_docker.sh
```
